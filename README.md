# stencil-nuxt-mr

This was _intended_ to be a minimum reproduction of an issue with the fix for non-shadow DOM slotted components as applied in `@stencil/core v3.3.0-dev.1685496483.a311f36`, but the 'issue' turned out to be user error on my end.  Keeping this around though as a reference for later just in case.
